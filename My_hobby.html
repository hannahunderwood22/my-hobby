<h1>Hannah's Hobby: Ballet</h1>

<p>Ballet is not only one of my favorite hobbies. It is my lifestyle. I started when I was twelve and fell in love with it. I practice at least five times a week for about three hours. I do mostly classical ballet but I also participate in lyrical and jazz.</p>

<p>People have a misconception that ballet is just twirling in tutus, but it is far more than that. Ballet takes hours of training and really takes a toll on your body, especially your <a href= "<a href= "http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=praying+mantis&view=detailv2&&id=5FC35955A6DB3BF2E6875748B6D11542BC44C085&selectedIndex=3&ccid=6QoTB8XW&simid=608014254645512687&thid=OIP.Me90a1307c5d600845287e078df6e4711o0&ajaxhist=0">feet.</a>. Pointe shoes are made of thick layers of paper hardened by glue.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Dancers and Future Career</h2>

<p>Some of my favorite dancers include <a href= "http://mistycopeland.com/">Misty Copeland,</a>, <a href= "https://www.google.com/search?q=natalia+osipova&safe=strict&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=667&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAhPHW5-7OAhWEmx4KHX_-CQkQ_AUICCgD&dpr=1#imgrc=wGArOnZ8JD24GM%3A</">Natalia Osipova</a>, and Mikhail Bartshnikov. Misty was the first African American dancer to achieve the principle title at American Ballet Theatre. Natalia is a Russian dancer who dances for the Royal Ballet in London. Mikhail is one of the most famous male dancers in history. He is currently 68 and has retired from dancing but still acts. All of these dancers inspire me and motivate me to keep up my hobby.

<p>Since ballet is one of my favorite activities, I have thought about continuing dancing in the future. Dancing in college is something I've thought serioiusly about and I'm considering colleges with impressive dance programs like FSU. Dancing as a professional though is not particuraly realistic for me. Few dancers make it to the professional level and if they do, the pay is very little for hours and hours of hard work everyday.<p>
